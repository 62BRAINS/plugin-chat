Chat for Kanboard
=================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kanboard/plugin-chat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kanboard/plugin-chat)

Basic internal chat for Kanboard users:

- Only one room for all users
- No one to one chat
- Notification on user mention
- Markdown rendering (Simplified)
- History of 50 visible messages
- Highlight unread messages
- 3 different views: minimized, normal and maximized

This is a very simple and minimalist chat extension. The goal is **NOT** to replace full-featured traditional chat applications.
If you need a more elaborated chat system, use something like Slack, Mattermost, RocketChat, Jabber or IRC.
